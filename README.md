# Asteroids (TempleOS Version)

A simple implementation of the classic arcade game *Asteroids*, written in **Holy C** for **TempleOS**. This project was created as a way to explore the unique programming environment and capabilities of TempleOS, while recreating a beloved arcade classic.

## Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugo-russeil/asteroids-templeOS.git
```

### Recommended Setup

If you're using a primary OS and would like an easy way to transfer files to TempleOS, consider using [Aiwinos](https://github.com/nrootconauto/Aiwnios). Aiwinos simplifies working with TempleOS by allowing you to run it within a virtual environment. You can also access the Aiwinos file system directly from your host OS, making it easy to drag and drop files, like this Asteroids project, directly into TempleOS.

If you're experienced with TempleOS setup via VM, feel free to load the project in TempleOS through your preferred setup.

## Compilation and Execution

TempleOS makes it easy to run Holy C code with a single key press:

1. Open `main.HC` in TempleOS.
2. Press **F5**. This compiles and runs the game immediately within TempleOS.

No need for makefiles or external dependencies—TempleOS is a self-contained system that handles compilation with a single keystroke.

## Usage

The controls for the game are as follows:
- Use the **arrow keys** to move your spaceship.
- Press the **space bar** to shoot.

## Features

This version of *Asteroids* is inspired by the original arcade game. The intent behind this project was to explore the Holy C language and the TempleOS environment, both of which are fascinatingly unique. As such, this isn’t an exact replica of the original game but captures the spirit of the original.

## Contributing

I am always looking to learn. If you have suggestions feel free to reach out. This project is about learning and exploration, and I’m open to feedback or insights on Holy C, TempleOS or my code in general.
